# react-express-components-demo
This is a sample react application where I use a react server and a node server proxy to pull usernames and messages from a database populate them to the DOM.

**TECH USED:** HTML, CSS, JavaScript, Node.js, React, JSX, MongoDB

**Installation:**
1. clone repo
2. open terminal and cd into project folder 
3. run `npm install` in both the `savage-auth` and `client-side` folders

**Use:**
1. in the `savage-auth` folder run `node server.js` to start the node server and navigate to `localhost: 8080`
2. in the `client-side` folder run `npm start` to start the react server, it will automatically open in your default browser on `localhost 3000`
